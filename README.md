# data512-finalProject

This repository is for a project for DATA512. It addresses questions about the COVID-19 pandemic. The assignment is broken into two phases: Phase 1 was to investigate the effect of masking during the COVID-19 pandemic in a specific county. Phase 2 was to come up with another research related to COVID-19, so I chose to investigate how the rate of incidence for the seasonal flu changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The src folder contains two notebooks where I made graphs and did the analysis for these two research questions. Below is the repository structure:
